text = """Edge , I trust that all is well with you .. I just wanted to say that it was good reconnecting .. 
you are still so many good things and I appreciated that .. but I think that the silent treatment , 
eggshells, discarding is just not something I can deal with again I was hopeful that this time 
would have been different. Anyway I wish you the best as I always have. I think it’s best for both of us … 
so I will not contact you in any shape way or form. No hard feelings this is just me accepting that it is 
what it is. You have been on me about taking off my profile pic / status etc … meanwhile you’re the one 
doing it (funny) anyway this time block me forever please … no more cycles necessary. … thank you for 
everything the good and even the not so good …. Take care."""
